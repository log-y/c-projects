phase_5:
string must be 6 characters long
the 'and' masks it, and only the last 4 bits are stored (values 0-15)
then does a LOOKUP OF EACH 4BIT LETTER in a 'table' at 401ea0
then stores what that number is (0-15) mapped to
checks the result of each character against whatever is stored at 0x401e53

plan: see whats at 0x401e53, see how u can get each character from the table

phase_6:
reads in 6 numbers

loads r12 into eax, subtracts 1 from eax. if eax > 5, it explodes
put 0 into esi, then there's a for loop (from [0 to 6)) (or 6 to 0 idk) 
moves all 6 numbers from stack into different registers

ITERATES THROUGH EACH 6 NUMBERS
- if the NEXT number is LESS THAN current number, it EXPLODES
the issue is that idk if it goes from index 6 to 0, or 0 to 6

0 i
1 s
2 r
3 v
4 e
5 a
6 w
7 h
8 o
9 b
10 p
11 n
12 u 
13 t
