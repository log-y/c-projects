Help Received:
We attended office hours, so thank you to the TAs that helped us!

What has been correctly and incorrectly implemented:
We believe that we have generally implemented the entire program correctly.
One hitch is that we do not free all the memory, but this is
because we used Hanson atoms. We did remove all of the other 
variables we malloc'ed.
We also noticed our program didn't correctly run on sail, turing, or alum
(the corrupted files in the corrupted repository). We think this is because
we couldn't correctly handle files with \0 already in them.
Another issue was that if there was an empty line, our program would instantly
 crash.
