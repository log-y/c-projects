Routine that took the longest:
Our function um_execute took the longest. More specifically, the
line:         word = *(uint32_t *)UArray_at(seg_zero, prog_counter);
in the while loop (prog_counter < seg_zero_len) took up a significant 
amount of time (16%) relative to other function calls due to repeated calls
of UArray_at.
There is no easy way to improve the assembly code without restructuring the
entire program. Instead of using UArray_at, it is possible to use a regular
C array, but this would require changing how the whole program is written.
